		<h1> After Tea and Cakes and Ices </h1>
		<p> Prufrock asks himself if he has the strength and courage to ask his overwhelming question. It is important to note the fact that he asks this question <br/><q>after tea and cakes and ices</q>. Considerable time has passed since this question was first mentioned in his heard, as he, in previous stanzas, has not<br/> had tea yet. This respectful manner of conducting business was referred to as <q>Xenia</q> in ancient Greece.<br/><img src="Pictures/DavidOC.jpg" width="auto" Height="475" align="left"> <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a book that I wrote and published, called <i>The Farmer and the Potato</i>, <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there is a chapter dedicated to the concept of Xenia. The basic rule of <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xenia as a host is to be hospitable to the guest and provide them with<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;food, drink, bath and gifts when they leave. Asking questions before a <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;guest has finished the meal provided to them is generally regarded to <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as impolite. In <i>The Farmer and the Potato</i>, David practiced good Xenia <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by asking if the potato needed anything despite not having much to offer. <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the poem, Prufrock also practiced good Xenia by finishing his food<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before even considering to ask his question. Good Xenia also appears<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the first book of <i>The Odyssey</i>, where Athena disguises herself as Mentes,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and approached Telemachus' home. Immediately, Telemachus greets the <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;guest and offers a meal for Mentes. He did not ask about why Mentes had <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;arrived at his home or who he even was until after the conclusion of his meal.</p>

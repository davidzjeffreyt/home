		<p> This video, regarded as a comedic effort, attempts to make the neighbourhood more comfortable by addressing the crimes <br/>that these offenders committed. Living in an area where criminals, especially sex offenders, may exist, can be frightening <br/>to many people. If you don't know the severity of the crime or who these criminals are, you could be living in a state of <br/>fear for the rest of your stay. To be afraid means to be in constant fear. Prufrock exclaims how he is reaching the end of<br/> his journey, where there is someone waiting there, holding his coat, expecting Prufrock to move. The place the Prufrock<br/> will go to, he will likely not return. This instilled fear into him, as he is afraid, like many of us are, of death. In <br/><i>The Yellow Wall-Paper</i>, the mansion that John and Jane moved into had been empty for years. Jane exlaims how<br/> there was legal trouble between heirs. There were greenhouses but they were all broken. She also directly stated <br/>that she was afraid, and that there was something strange about the house. To live in a place where you are in <br/>constant fear can often times be detrimental to your health, which is evident with Jane in the story.

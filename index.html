		<h2>Selected Excerpt</h2>
		<p>And the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so peacefully!<br /> 
Smoothed by long fingers,<br /> 
Asleep ... tired ... or it malingers,<br/>
<a href="David1.html">Stretched on the floor</a>, here beside you and me.<br/> 
Should I, <a href="David2.html">after tea and cakes and ices,</a><br />
Have <a href="Jeffrey1.html">the strength to force the moment to its crisis</a>?<br /> 
But though I have wept and fasted, <a href="Jeffrey2.html">wept and prayed</a>,<br /> 
Though I have seen my head (<a href="Jeffrey3.html">grown slightly bald</a>) brought in upon a platter,<br /> 
I am no <a href="David3.html">prophet</a> — and here’s <a href="David4.html">no great matter"</a>;<br /> 
I have seen the <a href="Jeffrey4.html">moment of my greatness flicker</a>,<br /> 
And I have seen the <a href="Jeffrey5.html">eternal Footman</a> hold my coat, and snicker,<br /> 
And in short, <a href="David5.html">I was afraid</a>.</p>

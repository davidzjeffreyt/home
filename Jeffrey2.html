		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>The Odyssey</i> and <i>The Penelopiad</i>, Penelope is mentioned to have been praying to Athene for the return of <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Odysseus and for the suitors to leave. One of the qualities associated with Penelope is how she weeps often such <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as when her husband is gone for almost 20 years, or when Telemachus leaves on his dangerous quest. In the poem, <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the speaker says he also weeps and prays to show that he is sad about the problems in his life, and is also looking <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for help/guidance just as Penelope was. In the modern era, it is common for an individual to be lost and as a result <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they will try to find their fit in society and a world with no order. Consequently, the speaker of this poem of weeping <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and praying to deal with this situation. The image I have drawn shows a women (Penelope) praying to represent <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the individuals praying in these texts.  I have also incorporated the colour red as a part of the womanâ€™s clothing <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to symbolize the passion the individuals have towards what they are praying for and the importance of these <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;things to themselves. </p>

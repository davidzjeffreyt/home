		<h1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eternal Footman</h1>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a picture of Odysseus returning home to fight off his suitors in <i>The Odyssey</i>. <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this violent scene, death is imminent to either to the suitors or to Odysseus and <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Telemachus as only one group will make it out of the hall alive. The “eternal Footman” <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(or death), is waiting to take some of these lives and this is what Eliot means by the <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eternal Footman holding his coat. In the hall, after Athena intervenes in the battle <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by displaying her sign (the aegis), the suitors realize that Odysseus has supernatural <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assistance. They panic and some even beg for mercy because they know death is <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;around the corner.</p>

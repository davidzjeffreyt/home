		<h1>The Strength to Force The Moment to its Crisis</h1>
		<h2><q><b>It does not take much strength to do things, but it requires a great deal of strength to decide what to do.</q> ~Elbert Hubbard</b></h2>
		<p>Elbert Hubbard was an American writer who lived from 1856 to 1915. This is one of his inspiring quotes left behind for us. The speaker in this poem is <br/>uncertain if he has “the strength to force the moment to its crisis” which is referring to the overwhelming question he wishes to ask. This overwhelming <br/>question would result in there having to be a big decision made which is why the speaker refers to it as a “crisis.” The speaker is not sure if he has the <br/>ability to do such a thing, or make such a decision. This quote is straightforward in the sense that it indicates that making decisions is harder than actually <br/>carrying them out. In addition to being applicable to this poem, it can also be applied in the context of <i>Frankenstein</i> when he was faced an immense decision <br/>as to whether or not he should create a female companion for the creature. Despite originally abstaining from doing so, he is convinced to make a female <br/>companion and after some consideration he decides to make one. However, he eventually destroys his latest project and changes is decision. It took a lot of <br/>strength to do that and to be prepared to face the consequences, but the actual action itself is done swiftly. </p>

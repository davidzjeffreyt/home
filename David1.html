		<h1> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stretched on the Floor </h1>
		<p> <br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the image on the last page of <i> The Yellow Wall-Paper </i> where John <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lays on the floor. In the poem, the evening is portrayed as stagnant or <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it may claim to be empty. Regardless, the evening is comfortable and <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;streched on the floor, encapsulating <q>you and me</q>. J. Alfred Prufrock <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is trying to tell the readers that it has become evening. Between him <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and us, nothing eventful is happening and everything appears calm. <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i> The Yellow Wall-Paper</i>, the evening might seem uneventful to John,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but this is not the case for Jane. In the concluding scene of the story,<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John barges into the room to see Jane creeping. In an instant, John <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;appeared to have fainted, stretched <q>right across my path by the <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wall</q> &#40;Stetson, 656 &#41;. John is the uneventful evening which lays beside<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jane and the woman, which is often argued to be her subconsious.</p>

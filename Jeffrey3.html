		<h1>"Grown Slightly Bald"</h1>
		<p>In modernism, there is often a focus on consciousness <br />and self-consciousness. Throughout this poem, the speaker is<br /> concerned with his appearance in society and is insecure <br />about certain physical attributes such as his baldness. I have <br />made a video to show that I am also concerned with my <br />appearance, even to the extent that I am concerned with how<br /> I will look in the future. In <i>The Graduate</i>, Benjamin <br />Braddock is also concerned with how others view him at first. <br />While being an exemplary student at college and pleasing his <br />parents and everyone around him, his appearance in society <br />is clearly important to him. He initially declines having an <br />affair with Mrs. Robinson because he does not want to <br />disrespect Mr. Robinson. Later he hides his affairs from<br /> everyone including his parents to maintain his image. <br />Even at the Taft hotel, he orders a room for one so people <br />don’t judge him sleeping with a women and he also gives <br />a fake name so that if people do find out his affairs, they <br />won’t know who he really is. Having a reputable image <br />in society is important to Benjamin at first, but later <br />disregarded.</p>

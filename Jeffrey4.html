		<p>This video depicts Derek Redmond, an Olympic athlete, snapping his hamstring during the 1992 Olympic Games. Just at the peak of the athleteâ€™s career <br />and greatness, his dreams are shattered and this burning fire of his amazing abilities flicker as it can no longer burn brilliantly like it used to. In this poem, <br />the speaker has seen this moment, when his greatness and his better days are now a thing of the past. This parallels Benjamin Braddock in <i>The Graduate</i> <br />as he was a respected and intelligent individual who was successful in many aspects at college, but after returning and not knowing what to do with <br />his future, these days of success morph into days of drinking alcohol, having sex, smoking, and taking life easy.</p>
